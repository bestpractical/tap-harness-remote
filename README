TAP-Harness-Remote version 0.0.1

Sometimes you want to run tests on a remote testing machine, rather
than your local development box.  C<TAP::Harness::Remote> allows you
so reproduce entire directory trees on a remote server via C<rsync>,
and spawn the tests remotely.  It also supports round-robin
distribution of tests across multiple remote testing machines.
